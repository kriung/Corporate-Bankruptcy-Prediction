# Corporate-Bankruptcy-Prediction
A project to predict corporate bankruptcy from various financial indicators
Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction Using Financial Indicators
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting corporate bankruptcy based on various financial indicators. The project leverages data from the Kaggle: Bankruptcy in Poland dataset to build predictive models that could assist businesses, investors, and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

üìÅ Project Overview
Corporate bankruptcy is a critical issue affecting businesses and stakeholders alike. By analyzing financial data, this project aims to:

Identify key financial indicators influencing bankruptcy.
Develop robust machine learning models to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy.
Provide actionable insights to mitigate financial risks.
